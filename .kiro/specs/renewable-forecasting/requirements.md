# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a renewable resources forecasting application that enables users to manage renewable energy sites, create portfolios, and run forecasting models. The MVP focuses on site management, visualization, and API-driven portfolio forecasting with a modular design that allows for easy integration of different forecasting models in the future.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a renewable energy analyst, I want to add new renewable energy sites to the system, so that I can build a comprehensive database of potential energy generation locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site management interface THEN the system SHALL display a map-based interface for site selection
2. WHEN a user clicks on a location on the map THEN the system SHALL allow the user to add a new renewable energy site at that location
3. WHEN adding a new site THEN the system SHALL require the user to specify site details including name, type (solar/wind), and coordinates
4. WHEN a site is successfully added THEN the system SHALL display the site as a marker on the map
5. WHEN a site is added THEN the system SHALL store the site information in the database with a unique identifier

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a renewable energy analyst, I want to remove existing sites from the system, so that I can maintain an accurate and current database of sites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an existing site marker on the map THEN the system SHALL display site details and management options
2. WHEN a user selects the remove option for a site THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before deletion
3. WHEN a user confirms site removal THEN the system SHALL delete the site from the database and remove the marker from the map
4. WHEN a site is removed THEN the system SHALL also remove it from any portfolios that contained it

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a renewable energy analyst, I want to create portfolios of renewable energy sites, so that I can group related sites for analysis and forecasting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the portfolio management interface THEN the system SHALL display a list of existing portfolios and option to create new ones
2. WHEN creating a new portfolio THEN the system SHALL allow the user to specify a portfolio name and description
3. WHEN managing a portfolio THEN the system SHALL allow the user to add or remove sites from the portfolio
4. WHEN viewing a portfolio THEN the system SHALL display all sites in the portfolio on the map with visual grouping
5. WHEN a portfolio is created or modified THEN the system SHALL persist the changes to the database

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a renewable energy analyst, I want to trigger forecasting runs for portfolios via API, so that I can integrate forecasting into automated workflows and external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request is made to trigger a portfolio forecast THEN the system SHALL validate the portfolio exists and contains sites
2. WHEN a valid forecast request is received THEN the system SHALL initiate a forecasting process for all sites in the portfolio
3. WHEN forecasting is in progress THEN the system SHALL return a job identifier and status information
4. WHEN forecasting is complete THEN the system SHALL store the results and make them available via API
5. IF a portfolio is empty THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a renewable energy analyst, I want to visualize forecasting results, so that I can understand the predicted energy generation for my portfolios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forecast results are available THEN the system SHALL display the results in the web interface
2. WHEN viewing forecast results THEN the system SHALL show both individual site forecasts and aggregated portfolio forecasts
3. WHEN displaying forecasts THEN the system SHALL include time series data with appropriate charts or graphs
4. WHEN no forecast data is available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no data
5. WHEN forecast data is outdated THEN the system SHALL indicate the age of the data to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the forecasting system to be modular, so that different forecasting models can be easily integrated for different site types in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs forecasting THEN it SHALL use a pluggable model architecture that allows for different models per site type
2. WHEN implementing the MVP THEN the system SHALL use a random number generator as the default forecasting model
3. WHEN a new forecasting model is developed THEN it SHALL be possible to integrate it without modifying core system logic
4. WHEN selecting a forecasting model THEN the system SHALL choose the appropriate model based on site type and configuration
5. WHEN no specific model is configured THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default random number generator

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a renewable energy analyst, I want the system to have a responsive web interface, so that I can access and manage sites from different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL provide a React-based frontend with Django backend
2. WHEN using the interface on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
3. WHEN interacting with the map THEN the system SHALL provide smooth navigation and site interaction capabilities
4. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading indicators and error handling
5. WHEN the system is unavailable THEN the interface SHALL display meaningful error messages to the user
