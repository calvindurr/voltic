- **PDF**: Report format with charts
- **PNG**: Chart images

## Tips and Best Practices

### Site Management

1. **Naming Convention**: Use consistent, descriptive names
   - Good: "Solar Farm Alpha - Nevada"
   - Avoid: "Site 1", "Test"

2. **Coordinate Accuracy**: Ensure coordinates are precise
   - Use GPS coordinates when possible
   - Verify locations on the map before saving

3. **Capacity Information**: Include capacity when known
   - Helps with forecast scaling
   - Useful for portfolio analysis

4. **Site Types**: Choose appropriate types
   - Solar: Photovoltaic installations
   - Wind: Wind turbine installations

### Portfolio Organization

1. **Logical Grouping**: Group sites by meaningful criteria
   - Geographic regions
   - Project phases
   - Technology types
   - Ownership structures

2. **Portfolio Size**: Consider optimal portfolio sizes
   - Small portfolios (5-10 sites): Detailed analysis
   - Large portfolios (50+ sites): Regional analysis

3. **Naming**: Use descriptive portfolio names
   - Include geographic or thematic information
   - Examples: "California Solar Portfolio", "Offshore Wind Phase 1"

### Forecasting Best Practices

1. **Forecast Timing**: Run forecasts at appropriate intervals
   - Daily forecasts for operational planning
   - Weekly forecasts for maintenance scheduling
   - Monthly forecasts for financial planning

2. **Horizon Selection**: Choose appropriate forecast horizons
   - Short-term (1-24 hours): Operational decisions
   - Medium-term (1-7 days): Maintenance planning
   - Long-term (1-30 days): Strategic planning

3. **Result Validation**: Always review forecast results
   - Check for unrealistic values
   - Compare with historical performance
   - Validate against weather conditions

### Data Quality

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep site information current
   - Update capacity after modifications
   - Remove decommissioned sites
   - Add new installations promptly

2. **Coordinate Verification**: Periodically verify site locations
   - Use satellite imagery
   - Cross-reference with official records
   - Update if sites are relocated

3. **Portfolio Maintenance**: Keep portfolios organized
   - Remove obsolete portfolios
   - Update portfolio descriptions
   - Reorganize as business needs change

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Site Creation Problems

**Issue**: "Site too close to existing site"
- **Cause**: Attempting to place a site within 11 meters of an existing site
- **Solution**: 
  - Check the map for nearby sites
  - Move the location slightly
  - Verify coordinates are correct

**Issue**: "Invalid coordinates"
- **Cause**: Latitude/longitude values are out of valid range
- **Solution**:
  - Latitude must be between -90 and 90
  - Longitude must be between -180 and 180
  - Use decimal format (e.g., 40.123456)

#### Portfolio Management Issues

**Issue**: Cannot delete site
- **Cause**: Site is part of one or more portfolios
- **Solution**: Remove site from all portfolios first

**Issue**: Portfolio appears empty on map
- **Cause**: Portfolio has no sites or sites are not visible at current zoom level
- **Solution**: 
  - Zoom out to see all sites
  - Check that portfolio actually contains sites
  - Verify sites have valid coordinates

#### Forecast Problems

**Issue**: Forecast job stuck in "Pending" status
- **Cause**: System overload or processing queue backup
- **Solution**:
  - Wait for system to process queue
  - Cancel and retry if stuck for >10 minutes
  - Check system status

**Issue**: "Empty portfolio" error
- **Cause**: Attempting to forecast a portfolio with no sites
- **Solution**: Add sites to the portfolio before forecasting

**Issue**: Forecast results not displaying
- **Cause**: Job failed or results not yet available
- **Solution**:
  - Check job status
  - Wait for job completion
  - Retry if job failed

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Map Loading
- **Check internet connection** for map tiles
- **Reduce number of visible sites** by filtering
- **Clear browser cache** and reload

#### Slow API Responses
- **Check network connection**
- **Verify backend server is running**
- **Check for large datasets** that might slow queries

#### Browser Compatibility
- **Use modern browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Enable JavaScript**
- **Clear browser cache** if experiencing issues
- **Disable browser extensions** that might interfere

### Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check the browser console** for error messages
2. **Review the API documentation** for correct usage
3. **Verify your environment setup** matches requirements
4. **Check the troubleshooting section** in the main README
5. **Contact system administrators** for persistent issues

### Error Messages
